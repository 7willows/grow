# GROW

## TODO

- add timeout to calls
- count number of service crashes and don't restart after certain amount of crashes
- `File` class which would accept filePath (an url). This way we wouldn't have to move buffers between workers
- queue and ability to inject queued services
- message bus
- websocket
- logs and ctx (as `this`)
- remove npm:ts-pattern dependency
